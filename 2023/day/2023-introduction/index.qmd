Welcome to my [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) journey! This year, I've decided to put a bit of extra-whimsy on this already whimsical set of puzzles by using a "spinning wheel" to decide whether I'll attempt to solve each day's puzzle using R or Python:

This method allows me to both strengthen my already substantial R skills and also improve my fluency in Python, a language in which I have more progress to make.

Also, in previous years, the Advent of Code challenges often caught me unprepared schedule-wise, either due to time constraints or other commitments. However, this year, I've planned ahead to ensure I can engage *at least* with half of the puzzles throughout December (committing to solve ALL the puzzles in December is still too much because some are very challenging, and, well, work and life continue).

I'll aim to post the solutions in a conversational, narrative manner, sharing not only the final code, but also the thought process I followed to solve each problem.
