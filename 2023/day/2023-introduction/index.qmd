Welcome to my [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) journey! This year, I've decided to put a bit of extra-whimsy on this already whimsical set of puzzles by using a "spinning wheel" to decide whether I'll attempt to solve each day's puzzle using R or Python:

This method allows me to both strengthen my already substantial R skills and also improve my fluency in Python, a language in which I have more progress to make.

I'll aim to post the solutions in a conversational, narrative manner, sharing not only the final code, but also the thought process I followed to solve each problem.

## On LLMs usage

I'm adhering to the [guidelines and suggestions made by the Advent of Code team](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about#:~:text=Can%20I%20use,programming%20for%20you.) regarding the use of LLMs like ChatGPT to solve the puzzles. That means I'm not using ChatGPT's help to arrive at the solutions I'm posting on this website. However, once I'm done with a problem (that means, either solving it or giving up), I may use LLMs to seek feedback or explore alternative approaches.
