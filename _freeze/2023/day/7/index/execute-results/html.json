A hand consists of five cards labeled one of A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2. The relative strength of each card follows this order, where A is the highest and 2 is the lowest.\n\n> Every hand is exactly one type. From strongest to weakest, they are:\n\n> -   Five of a kind, where all five cards have the same label: AAAAA\n>\n> -   Four of a kind, where four cards have the same label and one card has a different label: AA8AA\n>\n> -   Full house, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards share a different label: 23332\n>\n> -   Three of a kind, where three cards have the same label, and the remaining two cards are each different from any other card in the hand: TTT98\n>\n> -   Two pair, where two cards share one label, two other cards share a second - label, and the remaining card has a third label: 23432\n>\n> -   One pair, where two cards share one label, and the other three cards have a different label from the pair and each other: A23A4\n>\n> -   High card, where all cards' labels are distinct: 23456\n\n> Hands are ordered first by type. Then, the following rule applies:\n\n> Start by comparing the first card in each hand. If these cards are different, the hand with the stronger first card is considered stronger. If the first card in each hand have the same label, however, then move on to considering the second card in each hand. If they differ, the hand with the higher second card wins; otherwise, continue with the third card in each hand, then the fourth, then the fifth.\n\n> So, 33332 and 2AAAA are both four of a kind hands, but 33332 is stronger because its first card is stronger. Similarly, 77888 and 77788 are both a full house, but 77888 is stronger because its third card is stronger (and both hands have the same first and second card).\n\nAlso, there is a *bid* for each hand. In the example input:\n\n```\n32T3K 765\nT55J5 684\nKK677 28\nKTJJT 220\nQQQJA 483\n```\n\n> Each hand wins an amount equal to its bid multiplied by its rank, where the weakest hand gets rank 1, the second-weakest hand gets rank 2, and so on up to the strongest hand. Because there are five hands in this example, the strongest hand will have rank 5 and its bid will be multiplied by 5.\n\nIn this example, we first need to put the hands in order of strength.\n\n> - 32T3K is the only one pair and the other hands are all a stronger type, so it gets rank 1.\n> - KK677 and KTJJT are both two pair. Their first cards both have the same label, but the second card of KK677 is stronger (K vs T), so KTJJT gets rank 2 and KK677 gets rank 3.\n> - T55J5 and QQQJA are both three of a kind. QQQJA has a stronger first card, so it gets rank 5 and T55J5 gets rank 4.\n\nAfter doing that, we then multiply these ranks by their corresponding bids to calculate the total winnings.\n\nTotal winnings = (765 * 1 + 220 * 2 + 28 * 3 + 684 * 4 + 483 * 5) = 6440.\n\nThe prompt asks to obtain the number of total winnings the [input data](input){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n::: {#f7540ade .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Importing the data\n\nFirst, I'm loading all the puzzle input as a `numpy` array of strings/characters:\n\n::: {#d25f7f08 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ninput = np.loadtxt('input', dtype = 'object')\ninput[:5]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n```\narray([['99898', '978'],\n       ['T99A9', '198'],\n       ['43Q34', '550'],\n       ['KK8QK', '418'],\n       ['Q6Q57', '767']], dtype=object)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `input` array is kind of problematic since it combines cards and bids, which need to be processed differently. So, let's split the data into two lists, one for the cards, another one for the bids.\n\n::: {#7489b53e .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncards = list(input[:, 0])\nbids = list(map(int, list(input[:, 1])))\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Ranking the hands\n\nLet's assign points to the hands based on the rules and then sort or rank them based on those points.\n\nThe algorithm would be something like this:\n\n1. Identify the TYPE of the hand: five of a kind > four of a kind > full house > three of a kind > two pair > one pair > high card. Assign points based on that.\n2. Then, assign points based on the value of each of the cards of the hand, from left to right, using this sorting: (highest score) A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (lowest score).\n\nA reasonable way of doing this would be to create a `DataFrame` where each row is a hand, then add a column with the points based on type, followed by additional columns for each card's points. Finally, perform a `sort_values()`, first by the hand type column, and then using the card columns to the right to break any ties.\n\n### Function for Assigning Points Based on Hand Type\n\nLet's

strongest type possible.\n\n> To balance this, J cards are now the weakest individual cards, weaker even than 2. The other cards stay in the same order: A, K, Q, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, J.\n\nImplementing this change in the `points_by_card` function is straightforward. I just need to re-arrange the list that maps the cards to their scores.\n\n::: {#6c6587cc .cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nkinds_cards = list(\"AKQT98765432J\"[::-1])\n```\n:::\n\n\nBut I suspect incorporating this new logic into the `points_by_type` function will be more complicated. For each joker, we have to explore what is, potentially, the best type each hand could be if we could swap that joker for any other kind of card.\n\nIdea: create a function that receives as input the number of jokers in a hand, along with the original hand type (ignoring the joker rule) and returns the hand type considering the joker rule.\n\nFirst, let's see if this function is feasible and how it would work:\n\n- Five of a kind > This is the best hand possible, so it can't improve.\n- Four of a kind > two scenarios \n    - 4 jokers: the jokers can be swaped to match the odd card. Hand type would go up to *Five of a kind*.\n    - 1 joker: the joker can be swaped to match the other 4 cards. Hand type goes up too.\n- Full house > two scenarios\n    - 3 jokers: hand becomes *Five of a kind*.\n    - 2 jokers: hand becomes *Five of a kind* too.\n- Three of a kind > two scenarios\n    - 3 jokers: hand becomes *Four of a kind*.\n    - 1 joker: hand becomes *Four of a kind* too.\n- Two pair > two scenarios\n    - 2 jokers: hand becomes *Four of a kind*.\n    - 1 joker: hand becomes *Full House*.\n- One pair > two scenarios\n    - 2 jokers: hand becomes *Three of a kind*.\n    - 1 joker: hand becomes *Three of a kind* too.\n- High card > There can only be one joker by definition, which would turn the hand into *One Pair*.\n\nWe've confirmed that, depending on the number of jokers and the initial hand type, we can predict how the hand's type will change under these new rules (good news!).\n\nNow let's implement this logic as a function named `new_type`:\n\n::: {#4132a123 .cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef new_type(points_type, n_jokers):\n  if n_jokers == 0 or points_type == 7:\n    return points_type\n\n  # Four of a kind becomes five of a kind\n  if points_type == 6:\n    return 7\n\n  # Full house becomes five of a Kind\n  if points_type == 5:\n    return 7\n\n  # Three of a kind becomes four of a kind\n  if points_type == 4:\n    return 6\n\n  # Two pair can become four of a kind or full house\n  if points_type == 3:\n    if n_jokers == 2:\n      return 6\n    else:\n      return 5\n  \n  # One pair becomes three of a kind\n  if points_type == 2:\n    return 4\n\n  # High card becomes one pair\n  if points_type == 1:\n    return 2\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe also need a function that counts jokers:\n\n::: {#1314e1fe .cell execution_count=17}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Example case\nexample_card = 'JAJAJ'\nCounter(list(example_card))['J']\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=17}\n```\n3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#7f28e001 .cell execution_count=18}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef joker_counter(hand):\n  return Counter(list(hand))['J']\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext steps:\n\n1.
