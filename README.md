## Advent of Code Solutions

This project consisted in tackling some of the Advent of Code puzzles for year 2023. The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual series of programming puzzles that span a variety of computer science concepts, released daily throughout December as a countdown to Christmas.

### My Approach to AoC Challenges:

- **Problem Solving with R and Python**: I tackled the puzzles using both R and Python, leveraging the strengths of each language to find efficient and creative solutions.

- **In-Depth Explanations**: For each challenge, I provide detailed explanations of my thought process, the concepts involved, and the solutions I developed.

- **Code and Visualizations**: My solutions include both the raw code and visualisations (where applicable) to illustrate the problem-solving process more clearly.

- **Learning and Sharing**: I use AoC as an opportunity to sharpen my programming skills and to share my solutions with others, fostering a community of learning and growth.

- **LLM Guidelines**: In alignment with AoC's guidelines on using Large Language Models (LLMs), I didn't employ LLMs like ChatGPT or Copilot to solve any of the puzzles.
