Hi there! Welcome to this mini-site where I'll be sharing my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles. [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a series of increasingly difficult programming challenges, released daily each year throughout December in the run-up to Christmas.

To see my solutions and notes, just click on the corresponding year in the top navigation bar (though, as of now, I've only published solutions for [2023](/2023.html)).

This website is created using the [EllaKaye/advent-of-code-website-template](https://github.com/EllaKaye/advent-of-code-website-template) template repository. In the README of the repo you can find documentation on how to use it and adapt it, in case you can to publish your solutions in a similar format (which you should totally do üòÅ).
